We need to be able to move the player around in the map.  First we'll need a simple map to move around in.   Let's say it looks like this:

|1|2|3|
|8|-|4|
|7|6|5|

We need to:
 * ^TestCanMoveThroughMap
 * ^TestCantMoveOutOfMap
 * ^TestCommandAbbreviations
 * ^TestInvalidCommand
 * ^TestCanRest
 * ^TestPossibleDirectionsAreReported
